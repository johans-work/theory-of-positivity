# Theory of Positivity

If relativity is about time being relative, positivity is about time being positive, progressive, and unidirectional. 

Throwing a rock into a pond generates ripples. The throw must happen, the rock and pond must exist, the rock must hit the water, and only then will multiple ripples grow out from the point of contact. This order does not, and cannot change. 

When we observe something cause another thing, we identify this pattern as cause and effect. This also underpins common logic. The cause must always come before the effect. "If" must always come before "then". We see it, we do it, and we use it. 

Scientific statements must be backed by evidence. Observation must come first, then the utterance, then the logic. We may use existing logic to utter predictions, but in the end, truth only comes with observation of the evidence, and only then does the utterance become true, and only then can it serve as a true premise. This describes logical positivism, and underpins modern physics.

# The Metaphyics of "is"

nothing is anything
everything as something


we believe everything is something, and accept nothing as anything, exept metaphorically.
when it's the opposite. The notion that anything is some "thing" is metaphysics.
Everything can only be seen as something, not as being something.
